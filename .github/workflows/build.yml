  # ── Anchor program compile-check ──
  # NOTE: cargo-build-sbf bundles its own platform-tools with an old cargo (1.84)
  # that cannot parse blake3 1.8.x (needs unstable `edition2024`).
  # We use `cargo +nightly check` instead — it verifies the full crate graph
  # compiles correctly using nightly cargo (which supports edition2024).
  # The .so artifact is built locally and is already in the repo history.
